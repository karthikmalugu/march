# March
This is my first academic project, this project is about smart virtual assistant developed using Python.

March is a project which acts as a virtual assistant. Some of the functions of March are:
- Wikipedia Search
- Speak Time
- Send WhatsApp messages
- Greeting the user
- Send email to user
- YouTube video play and so on.

This is developed using some of the modules like pyttsx3, speech_recognition, pyautogui and so on.
